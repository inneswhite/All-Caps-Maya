# All Caps (WIP)
A maya tool for generating caps with different topology (Fan, strip, grid and max-area)

## About
[When Optimisations Work, But for the Wrong Reasons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hf27qsQPRLQ&t=869s) by SimonDev on YouTube, references the article [Triangulation](https://www.humus.name/index.php?page=Comments&ID=228) by Humus.
This article compares cap topology and their affect on rendering performance. The article finds that a max-area cap is the most performant, however this cap is difficult to make by hand in Maya. This inspired me to develop a tool that
allows for generation of different cap types depending on edge loop selection.

(I also spend a lot of time in MAXScript, and wanted a portfolio piece demonstrating Maya Tools Development)
